Some Information :

1.Some unnecessary fields were removed from dataset (‘Date’, ‘Referee’, ‘HTR’ etc)
2.The FTR (Full Time Result) is our target label which is to be predicted by the model, so we divided the data frames into two parts: feature set and target variable. 
3.All the categorical variables are converted into dummy variables (numerical).
4.There are some features with value 0 (i.e. the game that has not been played has attributes like ‘FTAG’, ‘FTAG’, ‘HS’, ‘AS’ value 0) except the Home Team name and the Away Team name.
